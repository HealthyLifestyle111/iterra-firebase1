                  <h4 style={{fontSize:15,color:"var(--champagne)",fontWeight:700,marginBottom:12}}>What is Network Marketing?</h4>
                  <p style={{fontSize:13,color:"var(--rosegold)",lineHeight:1.7,marginBottom:16}}>
                    Network marketing (also called multi-level marketing or MLM) is a business model where independent distributors sell products directly to consumers and earn commissions both from their personal sales AND from the sales of people they recruit into the business. Think of it as getting paid to share products you love AND teach others to do the same.
                  </p>
                  <p style={{fontSize:13,color:"var(--rosegold)",lineHeight:1.7,marginBottom:16}}>
                    Unlike traditional jobs where you trade time for money (and your income stops when you stop working), network marketing builds <strong>residual income</strong>. As your team grows and sells products, you continue earning even when you're sleeping, on vacation, or focusing on other things.

                  <h4 style={{fontSize:15,color:"var(--champagne)",fontWeight:700,marginBottom:12}}>Pyramid Scheme vs Legitimate MLM</h4>
                  <p style={{fontSize:13,color:"var(--rosegold)",lineHeight:1.7,marginBottom:12}}>
                    The #1 question you'll face: "Isn't this a pyramid scheme?" Here's the truth:
                  </p>
                  <div style={{padding:12,borderRadius:8,background:"rgba(230,183,165,0.08)",border:"1px solid rgba(230,183,165,0.12)",marginBottom:16}}>
                    <p style={{fontSize:12,color:"var(--champagne)",lineHeight:1.6,marginBottom:8}}>
                      <strong>Pyramid Scheme (ILLEGAL):</strong> You make money primarily from recruiting people. Little to no actual product is sold to real customers. Emphasis is on "paying to join" rather than selling products.
                    </p>
                    <p style={{fontSize:12,color:"var(--champagne)",lineHeight:1.6}}>
                      <strong>Legitimate MLM (LEGAL):</strong> You make money from selling actual products to real customers. Recruiting is optional but creates leverage. The FTC requires at least 70% of sales to go to non-distributors (real retail customers).

                  <p style={{fontSize:13,color:"var(--rosegold)",lineHeight:1.7,marginBottom:12}}>
                    Understanding your compensation plan is CRITICAL. Here's how it typically works:
                  </p>
                  <ul style={{fontSize:13,color:"var(--champagne)",lineHeight:1.8,paddingLeft:20,marginBottom:16}}>
                    <li><strong>Personal Volume (PV):</strong> The dollar value of products YOU personally purchase or sell each month</li>
                    <li><strong>Group Volume (GV) or Organization Volume (OV):</strong> The total sales volume of your entire team</li>
                    <li><strong>Retail Profit:</strong> When you sell products to customers at retail price, you keep the difference (typically 25%)</li>
                    <li><strong>Fast Start Bonuses:</strong> Extra commissions on new enrollments in their first 60 days (usually 20-30%)</li>
                    <li><strong>Unilevel Commissions:</strong> You earn 2-7% on the volume of people in your "downline" (people you enrolled and people they enrolled)</li>
                    <li><strong>Rank Bonuses:</strong> As you hit higher ranks (Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond), you unlock bigger percentage payouts</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p style={{fontSize:13,color:"var(--rosegold)",lineHeight:1.7,marginBottom:12}}>
                    Be honest with yourself and prospects. According to most company Income Disclosure Statements:
                  </p>
                  <ul style={{fontSize:12,color:"var(--champagne)",lineHeight:1.7,paddingLeft:20,marginBottom:16}}>
                    <li>70-80% of distributors earn less than $500/month (part-time, product enthusiasts)</li>
                    <li>10-15% earn $500-$2,000/month (active builders)</li>
                    <li>5-10% earn $2,000-$10,000/month (serious leaders)</li>
                    <li>1-2% earn $10,000+/month (top performers who treat it like a full-time business)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p style={{fontSize:13,color:"var(--rosegold)",lineHeight:1.7,marginBottom:16}}>
                    <strong>Timeline to profitability:</strong> Most successful builders take 6-12 months to replace a part-time income, 2-3 years to replace a full-time income. Anyone promising "get rich quick" is violating FTC rules.

                    Social media is the #1 way to build your wellness business in 2026 - but most people do it wrong.

                    "Why are these oils so expensive?" - you'll hear this CONSTANTLY. The answer isn't about price, it's about purity, potency, and cost-per-use. Here's how to confidently explain why therapeutic-grade essential oils are worth every penny (and actually cheaper than grocery store oils when you break it down).

                      $30 ÷ 300 drops = <strong>$0.10 per drop</strong><br/>
                      Typical use: 2-4 drops per application = $0.20-0.40 per use<br/>
                      One bottle lasts 2-6 months depending on frequency

                      NOT safe for internal use or undiluted topical application<br/>
                      Weak therapeutic effect - need 3-4x as many drops = $0.12-0.16 per use

                      <strong>THE TRUTH:</strong> Therapeutic oils are more cost-effective because they're PURE and POTENT. One drop of pure Peppermint oil = 28 cups of peppermint tea worth of active compounds.

                      Every batch tested to verify ZERO adulterants, synthetic fillers, pesticides, or heavy metals. Each bottle has traceable batch code linking to published test results. This is pharmaceutical-grade quality control.

                    <p style={{fontSize:12,color:"var(--champagne)",fontWeight:700,marginBottom:8}}>What Cheap Oils Contain (Proven by Independent Testing):</p>
                    <ul style={{fontSize:11,color:"var(--rosegold)",lineHeight:1.7,paddingLeft:20}}>
                      <li>Synthetic fragrance chemicals (cheaper than real plant extraction)</li>
                      <li>Carrier oil dilution (sold as "pure" but actually 20-50% diluted)</li>
                      <li>Pesticide residue from non-organic plant sources</li>
                      <li>Related species substitution (selling cheaper plant as expensive oil)</li>

                  <h5 style={{fontSize:14,color:"var(--champagne)",fontWeight:700,marginBottom:10}}>💪 Why Purity Matters for Results</h5>

                    <p style={{fontSize:12,color:"var(--champagne)",lineHeight:1.7,marginBottom:8}}>
                      <strong>Internal Use Safety:</strong> Only therapeutic-grade oils are safe for internal consumption. Synthetic oils and adulterants can cause liver damage, allergic reactions, and toxic buildup.
                    </p>

                      <strong>Therapeutic Potency:</strong> Pure oils have higher concentrations of active compounds (e.g., linalool in Lavender, limonene in Lemon). More active compounds = better results = fewer drops needed.

                      <strong>Your Response:</strong> "I thought the same thing at first! But let me show you the math. This $30 Lavender bottle has 300 drops. You use 2-4 drops per application, so it lasts 75-150 uses - that's 3-6 MONTHS. Compare that to a $6 bottle of melatonin pills that lasts 30 days, or $40/month on candles that don't even have therapeutic benefits. Plus, this Lavender works for sleep AND anxiety AND minor burns AND skin care - it's replacing 4-5 products you're already buying. When you break it down by cost-per-use AND factor in purity, it's actually the cheapest option. And once you're a member, you get 25% off everything for life.

I'd use 10 drops in my diffuser and barely smell it. Turns out they were diluted with carrier oil and synthetic fragrance (legal loophole - they can still call it 'lavender oil'). When I switched to therapeutic-grade, I only needed 2-3 drops for the same diffusion, AND it actually helped me sleep. The bottle costs $30 but lasts me 4 months instead of 3 weeks. Plus, I can use it internally for anxiety (can't do that with synthetic oils - you'd poison yourself). AND it's safe to apply undiluted to my skin for burns. One pure oil replaces five cheap products. That's why I pay more - it's actually LESS expensive when you calculate cost-per-use and multi-functionality. Make sense?"

                    <strong>Spend 80% of your time with the top 20% of your team.</strong> Most people waste time trying to "motivate" unmotivated people. Stop. Pour your energy into those who are ALREADY showing up. The rest will either catch fire later or stay customers. Both are okay.

                    Your warm market runs out. Usually within 90-120 days. This is where most people quit. But top earners understand: warm market gets you started, cold market builds your empire. Here's how to talk to complete strangers and turn them into customers and team members.

                    <li>They opted in because they're INTERESTED (not forced politeness)</li>
